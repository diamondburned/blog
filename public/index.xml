      <description>Another day with JavaScript is another struggle I have to say, JavaScript is not a fun language to work on.
The story is, today, Luke (the guy who requested me to fork Tale), asked me if I know of any method to add comments into his Hugo blog. I then thought, &amp;ldquo;hey that&amp;rsquo;d be nice if my theme integrates that.&amp;rdquo; I did just that.
How I came up with it Luke is a Linux user, and like many Linux users, privacy is priority.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Migrating over to Hugo is very easy.&amp;rdquo; This was my thought when I first make a document for my bot. I was astonished by the speed of it.

The theme I used was very flexible, and although I had trouble with the Hugo template, I quickly got used to it and changed most of the theme.</description>
