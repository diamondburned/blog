## Another day with JavaScript is another struggle

I have to say, JavaScript is not a fun language to work on.

The story is, today, Luke (the guy who requested me to fork Tale), asked me if I know of any method to add comments into his Hugo blog. I then thought, "hey that'd be nice if my theme integrates that." I did just that.

## How I came up with it

Luke is a Linux user, and like many Linux users, privacy is priority. That alone throws Disqus, Google Comments, et cetera... out the Windows (see that?).

## Initially a joke, is now a possible method

I made a joke statement, saying that making a new Git issue and then using that as the comment backend would be nice. Initially it was a joke. But then, a Google search got me [this](https://github.com/imsun/gitment).

## Holy #$%&!

It actually took me quite a while. Integrating this was a lot harder than I initially anticipated. After half a whole day (with no energy left), I finally managed to do it.
